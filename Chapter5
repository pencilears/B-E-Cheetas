1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?
emptyDictionary = {}

2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?
thisExample = {'foo':'42',}

3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?
lists are ordered, dictionaries have keys but can be in any order, so you can't slice them up the same way

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
you'd get a return of False because it's not there. 

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
one is a value, the other is a key. the keys to a dictionary seem to at like catergories 
so you might be able to store a number of sets of values in them. 
I don't know though, this is a little confusing.

6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?
this is confusing in the context of the preceeding question. is 'cat' with nothing to it a key or a value? 
I don't know. looks like neither, but a dictionary dosen't store anything but keys and values.

7. What is a shortcut for the following code?
if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'

setdefault() is the funcion you want, which if you wrote it out would look like:
spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?
pprint
