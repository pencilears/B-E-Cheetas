-There’s some kind of an event going on where people on bicycles think it is legal to run red lights if they all do it at once together. There’s hundreds of them. The light flashes red, then green then red again as they stream past the three who have parked themselves in the intersection. You’ve heard that these events are for raising awareness of bicycling fatalities and asserting bicycling rights. Mostly you’re made aware of the number of people who ride with zero safety equipment then blame society when things go wrong, and how hard a hippie can sneer at your elderly vehicle.
