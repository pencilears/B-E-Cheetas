Yo, let’s play a game, what’s 
Plot outline for game, you are a young merchant ready to set out on your first journey, this one should be easy it’s just to your grandma’s house
Starting location, mom’s house. 
You start off in the kitchen, your mother is out working but there is a small packet labeled [name]’s lunch on the countertop. Your pack is ready by the door. Your mother’s big black cat is snoozing in the windowstill’s morning light. 
Pet the cat?
  Mr Beans rubs his hand against your hand and purrs contentedly
	  [change checkCat to True]
Double check the pack?
	Your pack contains 6 units of fresh water
	Your wallet
	Your phone
	Your keys
	A small notebook and a pen
	Old person incontinence pads, light but bulky
6 different paperbacks, their covers imply impossibly cool people with impossibly interesting lives need to solve yet another murder and also endure family dinner with their mom. There’s also one about a lawyer who lives out of his car, the rest use a skull somewhere in the cover imagery.
	A plastic bottle of McNaulton’s 
	A loaf of fresh bread
	A can of grapefruit soda
	A small pack of salami, the meat of peace!
 		[add to inventory :6 water, tutorialPack, phone, keys, notebook, Change checkPack to True]
Check your lunch?
	It’s leftovers from last night and a note on a paper napkin
	[change checkLunch to true, add to inventory: 6 food]
		Check napkin?
			“I love you sweetie!” mom is the best
			[add to inventory: momNapkinNote]
				Leave her a note on the teapot [Y/N]? 
[set the value of noteOne to True or False] //a False value will trigger worried mom events, a True Value will trigger the Call From Mom event//

Get this party going? 
[if checkCat, checkPack, and checkLunch are all True progress to next area, else print “aren’t you forgetting something?” if checkCat is False print “that cat looks so soft” if checkPack is False print “what’s even in this thing?” if checkLunch is false print “Breakfast is for suckers, lunch is not, you’re going to need that”

[leaving the house]
You step outside to a forest dripping with last night’s rain, a thousand tiny rainbows sparkle on the trees, it’d be beautiful if it wasn’t a lot earlier than you usually get up. Your gallant mechanical steed awaits. You load up your pack and check your directions, grandma doesn’t live too far away but if she doesn’t get her Mcnaulton’s before midafternoon she’d going to be cranky. 

 Let’s blow this popsicle stand! 
[three event triggers for this, easy, easy, and the call from your mother if noteOne is True, else another easy event, timecounter set to 0, if time reaches 5 grandma will be mad her liquor is late] 

If noteOne = true
your phone buzzes in your lap, luckily traffic has ground to a halt check phone? [y/n]
[user choses y] you surreptitiously pull out your phone and check the message, mom got your note, tells you to ask grandma about the knickknacks when you get there]
-time + 0
 events are going to be theri own thing
 
 You have arrived at your grandparent’s apartment, it’s in an older part of what is not the swanky part of town and they are very proud of their tiny-sliver of lake-view off their porch. 

[If time <= 3 then cue happyGrandma]
Grandma is very happy to see you, it’s just noon you offload the groceries while she fixes lunch for you and grandpa, he seems a little more together today, if just as frail when hugged. The ever present smell of pee and old tobacco is a little milder today and you all have a nice time over lunch not talking about politics. 
[If time > = 3  then cue failGrandma]
Everything is late, it is all your fault, grandma’s alcoholism is catching up with her and her attempts to replace liquor with black coffee would have better succeeded if she’s been limited to a cup and a half about two hours ago. You hug everyone and leave. The atmosphere is strained and she’s going to call your mother. 
[Remove tutorialPack from inventory]
On leaving your grandma’s house you spot a shiny glimmer in one of their neighbor Nancy’s flowerpots, you investigate and it appears to be an easter egg? 
Pick up egg [Y/N]?
If [Y] the egg is cool to the touch, a little larger than a chicken egg and appears seamless, it is shiny and a speckled froggy green color, the shell feels leathery and a faint peeping sound can be heard from within. 
If [N] adventure is calling but adventure is lame and inconvenient. You are done with this nonsense and you are going home. (end game)
Peep back ?
you say “peep peep to you too, buddy” the eggs peeping begins to sound less frantic, it warms slightly in your hand as you hold it. 
	[set dragon gender to M]
			It’s obviously cold, warm it up
You hold the egg in your hands and think about tall boys with wide shoulders and rascally smiles, you blush hugely and your hands get hot and sweaty. The egg seems to like this and the peeping takes a happier tenor
	[set dragon gender to F]
Throw it in the air
You toss the egg up and catch it, the peeping sounds a little woozy, but it’s not as loud and that’s what we’re after.
	[set dragon gender to X]
You tuck the egg into your bra to keep warm, and return to your mighty steed. YOUR NEXT QUEST AWAITS!

You have completed the tutorial quest! You have delivered important items to your grandma and you have picked up the ~mysterious egg ~
