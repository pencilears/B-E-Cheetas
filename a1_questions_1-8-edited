question 1
Which of the following are operators, and which are values?
* is an operator, it multiplies
'hello' is a string, and therefore a value
-88.8 is an integer and therefore a value
- is an operator, it subtracts
/ is an operator, it divides
+ is an operator, it adds
5 is an integer and therefore a value

question 2
spam is a variable
'spam' is a string

question 3
name 3 datatypes, 
char (a single character) 
string (a series of characters) 
integer (a whole, rational, number)

question 4
what is an expression made of, and what do they do?
an expression is a basic command to a computer, it takes in values, 
manipulates those values with an operator, and evaluates down
to an end result. 

a value with no operators can also act as an expression, but it 
is one that does nothing.

question 5
what is the difference between an expression and a statement? 
an expression does a thing. (it evaluates) 
a statement creates a thing.(assigns a value to a variable)

question 6
if the variable bacon starts out with a value of 20, and then you 
run the expression bacon + 1, then bacon would be equal to 21.

question 7
'spam' is a string, when strings are considered the + operator instead of trying to add 
mathematically that which is not anumber concatenates instead by adding one string to
the end of another. when you multiply a string likewise you are asking a mathmatical
operator to operate on a non-math thing. it thus acts as a for-loop that prints the 
string for the requested number of times.

'spam' + "spamspam" and 'spam' * 3 would both evaluate to spamspamspam but for 
different reasons

question 8
eggs is a valid variable name while 100 is not valid, because 100 is a number. 
while eggs might be assigned as a variable to equal 100, 100 inherently has the 
numerical value of 100. if you could tell the computer 100 = 5 things would get messy. 
global variables are bad enough.
