Chapter 4 practice questions

1.	[]  is two square brackets, for the purpose of this chapter  it is an empty list.

2.	spam[3]  = ‘hello’

3.	‘3’ is a string, this would error out.

4.	The last entry in the spam[] list, so ‘d’

5.	Ordinal counting strikes again, this is ‘c’

6.	1 

7.	[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99,]

8.	[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99,]

9.	+ concatenates as usual, *and an integer replicates that specified number of times

10.	Append puts it on the end, insert puts it anywhere you want it.

11.	Remove and delete (del)  del is useful when you know where the thing you want to get
rid of is on the index. Remove will just take out the first instance it finds in the list. 

12.	They can be concatenated, you can have a string in your list, you can bring them up 
like string values in the middle of other strings. A string is kinda like a list of chars. 
And strings are apparently immutable in python. So that’s something.

13.	You write a list with [] you write a tuple with () and tuples are like strings in 
that they are not modifiable. You cannot modify, append, or remove the values in a tuple. 
You do need a trailing comma though.

14.	tuple(42,)

15.	they can act like a function, list(nameOfTuple) will listify the tuple. tuple(nameOfList)
will tupleify the list. At least I think so, this bit was not super clear.

16.	A pointer to the list itself.

17.	deepcopy will copy the inner lists
