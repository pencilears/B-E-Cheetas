Q:1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
1 or 0 also written as True or False

Q:2. What are the three Boolean operators?
And, Or, Not.

Q:3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator 
(that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

true and true : true
true and false : false
false and true: false
false and false : false

true or true : true
true or false : true
false or true : true
false or false : false

not true : false
not false : true

Q:4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
False

not (5 > 4)
False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
True

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False

(True and True) and (True == False)
False

(not False) or (not True)
True

Q:5. What are the six comparison operators?
< less than
> greater than
! not, is a little diffrent the bang sign modifies an operator 
like so: != not equals, !< not less than, !> not greater than

== equal to, written like this with double = to distingiuish 
it from the assignment operator, when modified to work with
 other variables python removes the first = mark so you cam make: 
<= less than or equal to, >= greater than or equal to, or != not euqual to.


Q:6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
== is equal to, = is the assingment operator

Q:7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
a condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value
you might use one to check if you should trigger a part of your program to run.
for example, if the player is in the room, then make the orcs attack, 

Q:8. Identify the three blocks in this code:


spam = 0  // starting value for the spam variable, is it's own block

if spam == 10: 
    print('eggs') //this indent shows we are looking at a new block of code
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') //this indent indicates the third block
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

Q:9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! 
if anything else is stored in spam.
 
 spam = 0
 if spam == 1: 
    print('Hello')
    if spam == 2 :
        print('Howdy') 
    else:
        print('Greetings!')
    print('Greetings!')
print(spam)

Q:10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
[ctrl] + C

Q:11. What is the difference between break and continue?

break stops the flow and breaks out of the thing, continue skips a step and keeps going.

Q:12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

range 10 goes from 

Q:13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 
using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that 
prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Q:14. If you had a function named bacon() 
inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet,
 and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
